# Fractal Recursion Project

The fractal recursion program allows you to visualize the recursive process used to create numerous shapes.

● Implemented recursive methods, List interface and imported Java visualizers to print out repeating lines and points
to generate numerous types of images such as trees and triangle patterns.

● Created logic to let the user specify how many repeated cycles of the method they want to see
visualized.

● Project was created to understand how recursion works with a more visual and intuitive
demonstration.
